## How to play
The rules are generally the same as in Reversi.
Black moves first, and you can place a piece by selecting the desired piece and then clicking on an available space (which will be indicated in yellow).

The following points are different from normal Reversi:
- The pieces are assigned numbers from 1 to 10. You can only turn over pieces that are smaller than the sum of the pieces at both ends of your own pieces when sandwiching the opponent's pieces.
However, even if the opponent's pieces are larger than the sum of their pieces, you can place a piece if you can sandwich the opponent's pieces.
- The outcome is determined by the sum of each piece's numbers, not the number of pieces of each color.
- If there is no space to place the piece, it will automatically become the opponent's turn, and the number of the largest numbered piece among the opponent's pieces used will increase by 1 as a penalty.
